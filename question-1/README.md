# Question 1: Recursive Tower of Hanoi with Color Constraints

## Description
Solves the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with an additional constraint: disks of the same color cannot be stacked on top of each other.

The solution uses recursion to move all disks from source rod 'A' to target rod 'C', using auxiliary rod 'B'.
